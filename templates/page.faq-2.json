            "answer": "<p>The mower needs a fairly clear view of the sky—at least 60 degrees open—for it to work properly. If the area is fully covered or surrounded by tall trees or buildings, it might not perform well.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>Yes—it uses RTK technology for super-precise positioning, so you’ll need an RTK base antenna set up at home in a good spot. If you already have one nearby or access to a third-party RTK device, that works too! This setup helps the mower stay accurate and efficient while it works.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>If more than half of your yard is fully shaded during summer, especially by dense tree cover, the mower might not perform at its best. It’s designed to work with a clear view of the sky—so if that’s not the case, we recommend chatting with us first to find the best setup for your lawn!</p>"

But it doesn’t stop there — with regular charging cycles, it can maintain a total area of up to <strong>1.5 acres</strong> (approximately <strong>65,340 square feet</strong>) week after week.

            "answer": "<p>Have 1.5 acres? BESTMOW can maintain it within the week with routine daily mowing sessions. If your property is smaller, mowing will take less time. One unique advantage of the BESTMOW subscription is <strong>ongoing hardware upgrades</strong> — when we improve the product, you get the new version automatically, so your mowing time may decrease even more over time.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>On a single charge, BESTMOW can mow four hours depending on terrain and grass height. As part of the subscription, you’ll never worry about battery replacements — they’re included for free. For non-subscribers, replacing a battery typically costs <strong>$100–$200</strong>.

            "answer": "<p>BestMow T100 is designed for regular maintenance, so it works best when the grass is kept in check. If the grass is <strong>over 10cm and really dense</strong>, it might struggle a bit. However, for grass <strong>up to 15cm</strong>, you can still mow effectively by temporarily turning off obstacle avoidance. For best results, we recommend keeping your lawn trimmed regularly!</p>"
